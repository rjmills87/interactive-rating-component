### What I learned

The most notable thing I learnt during this project was how to add custom styles to radio inputs within a form. I tried to tackle this myself but after hitting a wall I went searching online for a solution and came across a short video on youtube which was extremely helpful. I have linked this below in the useful resources section of this README.

### Continued development

I am going to continue to work through more Frontend Mentor challenges as I often struggle to come up with project ideas and they provide plenty of variety. I intend to work my up to more complex projects alongside learning new frameworks and technologies

### Useful resources

- [YouTube - Custom Radio Buttons with CSS - [HowToCodeSchool.com]](https://youtu.be/mouR7XHcQ0k?si=qrZvzlvi2lb2_GQH) - This helped me when I was having great difficulty correctly implementing the correct styling to the radio inputs within the rating component.

- [W3 Schools - HTML Forms](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp) - I used the W3 Schools documentation on HTML Forms to refresh my memory on how to correctly structure a form and how to implement various inputs and add the correct properties (id, type, name) etc.
